# Void Minded

## Project description
Void Minded was born from the idea of helping me to compose my music. Since June 2018 I joined
the Void Shelter band in Nantes in which I try to improve my musical knowledge and my learning
of my instrument, I'm a guitar player.

Also I wanted to find a personal interest in an extra-professional project and show to future
employers my willingness and ability to explore tools.

So I had the idea to develop a musical composition chords helper for me and my band.
