## Project description
Void Minded was born from the idea of helping me to compose my music. Since June 2018 I joined
the Void Shelter band in Nantes in which I try to improve my musical knowledge and my learning
of my instrument, I'm a guitar player.

Also I wanted to find a personal interest in an extra-professional project and show to future
employers my willingness and ability to explore tools. In addition, this is my first Flutter project.

So I had the idea to develop a musical composition chords helper, firstly for me and my band.

## Documentation (french)
On this Google Sheet link you could find all information I wrote during the conception et the 
development of Void Minded. Besides the code, I tried to make the most complete document I can 
in which I put some ideas for the application and some technical specifications and style guide.
